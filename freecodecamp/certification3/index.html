          Python is highly in-demand: It is used by global organizations,
          start-ups, and individual developersâ€”and its popularity is only
          growing. Everyone can benefit from Python skills: Python is useful for
          data analysts, data scientists, and new and experienced developers
          alike.

          JavaScript is so versatile that you can use it to easily add cool
          design elements such as animation, interactive maps, and scrolling
          video. Organizations and clients want web designers who can not only
          put together a technically sound page but one that also will lure
          visitors. If you know JavaScript, you can deliver.

          Learning HTML can provide tremendous value to people working in tech,
          as well as to those who are running their own business or managing a
          website. Even if you just want to create an online portfolio for your
          work, HTML can be a fantastic skill to have in your repertoire.

          As you can see, CSS is critical when it comes to the overall
          presentation of a web page. And not only that, it makes developers'
          life a whole lot easier when it comes to formatting. Mastering CSS is
          a vital part of becoming a valuable asset and a solid programmer.

          Speed and efficiency are two of the big draws of using Java. It's also
          one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn. Because
          many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically,
          you won't have to do an intense study of how everything works as much
          as you would with a low-level language.
